# my1stRepo

my1stRepo is my very first public repository in github. It is a platform in which we are going to append certain image conversion techniques with the best quality image.


## Getting Started

To get started, we first need to install the modules **numpy**, **cv2**, **tkinter** and **ascii_magic**. This can be done in the command prompt by the command `npm install <module-name>`. We also downloaded and installed three AIs - prototext, caffemodel and npy.


## AIs

- **PROTOTEXT** : A prototype machine learning model created for use with Caffe. It contains an image classification or image segmentation model that is intended to be trained in Caffe.
- **CAFFEMODEL** : A machine learning model created by Caffe. It contains an image classification or image segmentation model that has been trained using Caffe. CAFFEMODEL files are created from .PROTOTXT files.
- **NPY** : A standard binary file format for persisting a single arbitrary NumPy array on disk.  It is used over CSV for reading large numerical data set.

**Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding)** is a deep learning framework that allows users to create image classification and image segmentation models.
